![A Better KYC awaits. On-Chain. Fully verifiable](./TitlePage.png)

- As part of the build backdrop project to build something in Crypto and interface with backdrop partners to get it launched

- Incorporating steganography in content in order to combat deepfakes

- Output of this project : PoC of a service that helps users to prove authenticity of content - inbuilt attestations in content using steganography

- What does an authentic content look like? At a pixel level?

- Create a service for user to prove authenticity of content - content demarcated with a steganographic curve and minted on chain

- This project will also seek to solve a problem of the Consumer Layer of Crypto - the user friendly interface that is sometimes lacking in these services.

- To start : node server.js

- Building a client interface for B2B integrations and generate repticles

- Repticles : Authenticity attestations based on Steganography. The token generated can have a watermark embedded inorder to have show genuine content - this is a step against deep fakes and synthetic info. At the same time need to create a light client - that only checks for authentic watermarks
