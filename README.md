# reputation-graph
- As part of the build backdrop project to build something in Crypto and interface with backdrop partners to get it launched

- Follows a similar concept like the lens protocol however the use case is for reputation and credibility

- Output of this project : PoC of a identity network that is composable with other service providers

- What does a good identity look like? Why are government IDs acceptable forms of identification? What is wrong with Self-Sovereign Identity? I have more questions than answers at this point of the project

- One thing that is common to both identity and currency is the social acceptance of these units with an authoritative seal that demarcates proof-of-value over random monopoly game units

- This project will also seek to solve a problem of the Consumer Layer of Crypto - the user friendly interface that is sometimes lacking in these services. To access UNISWAP for financial services or Lens for social services, maybe you are using ENS for SSO however there lies a problem of centralization when you use a name service

- Reputation graph will help you import a network-graph of value from your interactions with these services which will assist you in creating use-case specific validation services
